# smart-t-shirt
Smart t-shirt with received based on Arduino and Nrf24L01

The smart t-shirt is personal project that I have developed back in 2013 with the intention of creating smart clothing for :
- Elderl people
- People working in high risk positions
- Undercover workers
- and many others...

This project was developed by my fully using public available libraries and modifications added to them . 

The main idea is that your board that acts as a t-shirt will gather the data from all the sensors and then will send it OTA using the NRF24L01 TX/RX moculeds to a receiver board that will show the data on an LCD/Display and also output it on a serial port. 

This code can be modified or adapted to work with BLE, Zigbee and so on...

This code is released to encourage people to learn and push their boundaries. 

This code can not be copied, modified or used in any commercial product as it is the IPR or Pauciuc Mihai-Stefan and it would consist the background IP of any project in which it will be used. 

This code comes with no guarantee and it is your sole responsibility if you shall wish to use it to check pinouts, pin definitions in both comments of the and libraries and make the proper electrical connections to get it up and running.
